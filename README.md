Utilities
=========

In here you'll find little things I've made to make life go faster.


device-info.rb
=========

This is a device diagnostic script that gathers typical information about the host. Instead of manually executing commands, it'll be quicker to get everything into a subdirectory and leisurely peruse the output. Facter in Puppet does something like this, but this gets you data...not information.


ebay-seller_template.html
=========

When you sell things on ebay, you want to give potential customers a good user experience. This means that you want to guide and direct them into the important bits of information that they want to know about. This template was made to do just that. The CSS was made inline purposefully to work with ebay and craigslist.
