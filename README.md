Utilities
=========

In here you'll find little scripts I've made to make life go faster.


device-info.rb
=========

This is a device diagnostic script that gathers typical information about the host. Instead of manually executing commands, it'll be quicker to get everything into a subdirectory and leisurely peruse the output. Facter in Puppet does something like this, but this gets you data...not information.
